            <p>The game is kind of played liked War, but dumber. The goal is to win all the cards from your opponent.</p>
            <p>The Player is dealt 3 cards. Choose one of the cards to play and the computer will randomly select a card to oppose it. The player who wins takes both cards.</p>
            <p>Which Card Wins? The only way to find out is to play.</p>
            <p>When your pile of cards is empty you'll shuffle all the cards you've won into your new draw pile.</p>
            <p>If you play a card that has not been named you will need to name it.</p>
            <p>If you play a match up that has never been played you decide which card wins, and you decide why!</p>
